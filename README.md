# Bluesky-mental-health
This study examined mental health discourse characteristics, information source credibility patterns, and network structural dynamics within Bluesky's decentralized federated ecosystem. The analysis comprised 100,747 depression-related posts from 3,831 authors and 138,574 repost actions across 84,048 users. Systematic URL normalization, Media Bias/Fact Check domain-level credibility mapping, and repost-based audience similarity network construction through cosine similarity metrics were employed. Zero-shot classification using Flan-T5-Large categorized mental health content, while PageRank centrality and Louvain community detection identified influential authors and network clusters. Results revealed that depression-related discourse exhibits low external source citation rates (20\% of posts contained URLs; only 1.4\% mapped to credibility-indexed domains), with 98.6\% of content operating beyond conventional credibility assessment frameworks. Among credibility-assessable sources, reliable outlets exceeded questionable sources threefold (1,093 versus 345 posts). Mental health classification showed that depression-specific content constituted merely 3\% of authors despite purposive sampling, while stress (17\%) and anxiety (14\%) proved more prevalent. The audience similarity network (300 influential authors, 5,300 edges) exhibited moderate density (11.8\%), strong local clustering (0.672), and substantial fragmentation (12 disconnected components), with Louvain detection identifying 18 communities demonstrating pronounced content homophily, notably Community 1's anxiety specialization (52.5\%) versus Community 0's non-clinical focus (96.6\%). These findings establish that federated platform mental health communication operates primarily through personal testimony rather than external attribution, exhibits fragmented network structures enabling protective community clustering, and captures diverse psychological distress discourse beyond focal condition boundaries. Results demonstrate limitations of conventional credibility frameworks for health discourse while revealing emergent community-based information quality mechanisms in decentralized architectures.
